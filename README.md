# A Multiform Optimization Framework for Constrained Multi-Objective Optimization
This is the matlab version of MFO for constrained multi-objective optimization problems. The code is under the framework of PlatEMO.
Please note: MFO-SPEA2 is recommended for solving constrained optimization problems with two or three objectives, while MFO-MOEA/D is recommended for addressing constrained optimization problems with more than three objectives.
